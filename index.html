		<h1>Wham -Last christmas</h1>
		<p>Last Christmas 
		I gave you my heart 
		But the very next day 
		You gave it away 
		This year 
		To save me from tears 
		I'll give it to someone special </p>

		<p>Last Christmas 
		I gave you my heart 
		But the very next day 
		You gave it away (you gave it away)
		This year 
		To save me from tears 
		I'll give it to someone special (special)</p>

		<p>Once bitten and twice shy 
		I keep my distance 
		But you still catch my eye 
		Tell me baby 
		Do you recognize me? 
		Well 
		It's been a year 
		It doesn't surprise me </p>

		<p>(Merry Christmas) </p>

		<p>I wrapped it up and sent it 
		With a note saying "I love you" 
		I meant it 
		Now I know what a fool I've been 
		But if you kissed me now 
		I know you'd fool me again </p>

		<p>Last Christmas 
		I gave you my heart 
		But the very next day 
		You gave it away (you gave it away)
		This year 
		To save me from tears 
		I'll give it to someone special (special)</p>

		<p>Last Christmas 
		I gave you my heart 
		But the very next day 
		You gave it away 
		This year 
		To save me from tears 
		I'll give it to someone special (special)</p>

		<p>A crowded room 
		Friends with tired eyes 
		I'm hiding from you 
		And your soul of ice 
		My God I thought you were 
		Someone to rely on 
		Me? 
		I guess I was a shoulder to cry on </p>

		<p>A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
		A man undercover but you tore me apart </p>

		<p>Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again </p>

		<p>Last Christmas

		But the very next day 
		You gave it away (you gave it away)

		<p>Last Christmas

		You gave it away 
		This year 
		To save me from tears

		<p>A face on a lover with a fire in his heart 
		A man under cover but you tore him apart 
		Maybe next year I'll give it to someone 
		I'll give it to someone special.
		(Special. Someone. Someone.)
		I'll give it to someone...</p>
